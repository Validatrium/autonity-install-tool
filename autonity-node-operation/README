### Autonity Node Operations by Validatrium

In the world of blockchain technologies, setting up a validator node and the infrastructure for its hosting is a key step in ensuring the stable operation of the network and receiving rewards for participating in transaction validation.

In this article, [Validatrium](https://validatrium.com/) Team will discuss the key steps to install a validator node and create the infrastructure for hosting it for you to be sure that choosing us is the best option.

In the screenshots below, you will find a detailed description of our validation/public RPC node setup and hosting infrastructure, exploring design tradeoffs.

**Installing a Validator Node**

1. Installing GOlang and EthKey. Our Team should ensure that [GOlang](https://go.dev/doc/install) and [EthKey](https://ethkey.net/) are installed on our server, as they are necessary for the operation of the validator node.

2. Installing Pipx and the aut tool for Ubuntu 20.04. What we need to do here is to install [Pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx), and execute the necessary commands for your operating system. Then install the aut tool, which will help manage the validator node.

3. Creating a file for configuring the aut utility. This step requires us to create a file specifying the configuration of the validator node.

4. Installing Node. Here we need to install a node on our server to perform various operations with the validator node.

5. Creating a tresure.key. This key will be used for delegating and receiving rewards for validating transactions.

6. Creating an oracle.key. This key will be used to identify the Oracle server and sign price report transactions.

7. Funding the Oracle wallet. After launching the validator node, we ensure that the Oracle wallet is funded to prevent errors in the first transaction.

8. Generating a Nodekey. An important step is where we need to create a Nodekey for our validator node.

9. Creating a directory. So, we ought to create a directory to store the configuration files and keys of Validatrium’s node.

**Infrastructure for the Node**

In this chapter we will try to explain the main settings for the infrastructure and why it matters. To ensure the reliability and availability of our validator node, it is recommended to use the following infrastructure parameters:

Baremetal servers. For operating the validator node, it is preferable to use servers with a Ryzen 9 5950x CPU, 128GB ECC RAM, 2x4TB NVME SSD, and a 1GB/s network connection or equivalent.

Choice of hardware for the node infrastructure. Preference for using baremetal servers with high performance, such as Ryzen 9 5950x CPU and 128GB ECC RAM, can increase the reliability and performance of the node but may be expensive to maintain compared to virtualized solutions.

Using multiple providers. To ensure the reliability of the validator node’s infrastructure, it is recommended to use multiple providers such as contabo, hetzner, digital ocean, and AWS.

This increases the reliability of the infrastructure by distributing the risk of failure among different providers, but it can lead to increased management complexity and possible additional costs.

Virtualization with proxmox. For flexibility and management of the validator node’s infrastructure, it is recommended to use virtualization with [proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/). This allows for easy scaling and moving nodes between hosts without downtime.

Implementing virtualization allows for easy scaling and moving of nodes between hosts without downtime, but it may require additional resources and increase the complexity of setup and management.

Monitoring with Zabbix and Grafana. To ensure the stable operation and monitoring of the validator node, it is better to use [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for monitoring and alerting about potential issues.

This provides reliable monitoring and alerting about problems but may require additional resources and time for setup and maintenance.

Setting up a validator node and its infrastructure for hosting is a key step in ensuring the stable operation of the Validatrium node and maximizing the return on participating in transaction validation. Therefore, when choosing and setting up infrastructure for the validator node, it is necessary to consider these tradeoffs and find the optimal balance between reliability, performance, and costs.

**Conclusion**

Setting up a validator node and its infrastructure for hosting is a crucial step in ensuring the stability and efficiency of a blockchain network. In the context of the Autonity project, the Validatrium validator node offers several advantages and plays a key role in the network’s operation.

One of the key benefits of using Validatrium as a validator node is its robust infrastructure, which includes baremetal servers with high-performance specifications. This infrastructure ensures reliability and performance, crucial for maintaining the integrity of the Autonity network.

Additionally, Validatrium’s use of multiple providers such as contabo, hetzner, digital ocean, and AWS enhances the network’s resilience by reducing the risk of downtime or service interruptions.

The virtualization aspect of Validatrium using proxmox offers flexibility and scalability, allowing for easy expansion and management of the validator node infrastructure. This is essential for adapting to the changing demands of the Autonity network.

Furthermore, Validatrium’s monitoring setup with Zabbix and Grafana ensures real-time visibility into the performance and health of the validator node. This proactive monitoring helps in identifying and addressing any issues promptly, contributing to the overall stability of the network.

In conclusion, the use of Validatrium as a validator node in the Autonity project offers a robust and reliable solution for participating in the validation process. Its infrastructure, virtualization, and monitoring capabilities make it a valuable asset in ensuring the success and efficiency of the Autonity network.
