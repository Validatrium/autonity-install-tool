Explore the process of generating cryptographic keys and wallets for various purposes within a blockchain network based on the Autonity protocol. Let's delve into each part:

#### Generating nodekey:
- This step generates the main key for a node, which is used to derive the validator address and enode.
- Use the `genAutonityKeys` command to generate the nodekey and write the corresponding address.
- The output includes the node address and public key.

#### Creating directories for tresure.key and oracle.key:
- This establishes separate directories to store the keys for the "treasure" and "oracle" purposes.

#### Creating oracle.key wallet:
- This step initiates a wallet for the oracle key and saves the generated file in the specified directory.
- It likely prompts the user to set a passphrase for the wallet, which should be remembered or securely stored.

#### Creating tresure.key wallet:
- Similar to the previous step, this generates a wallet for the "treasure" key and saves the file in the designated directory.
- Again, it likely requires setting a passphrase for the wallet.

#### Adding tresure.key to .autrc:
- This involves modifying the .autrc file to include the path to the tresure.key file.
- It ensures that the node will use the tresure key for specific operations, such as delegation and receiving rewards.
