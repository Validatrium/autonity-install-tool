### Deploying RPC Nodes for Autonity:

- Set up your RPC nodes on the provisioned virtual machines or containers.
- Configure the RPC software.

### Setting Up Nginx:

- Install and configure Nginx on your server instances to act as a reverse proxy.
- Configure Nginx to distribute incoming RPC requests among your RPC nodes for load balancing and fault tolerance.
- Implement SSL/TLS termination in Nginx to ensure secure communication with clients.

### Configuring Cloudflare:

- Set up a Cloudflare account and add your domain to it.
- Configure Cloudflare DNS to point your domain to the public IP address of your Nginx server.
- Enable Cloudflare's DDoS protection features to safeguard your infrastructure from malicious attacks.
- Utilize Cloudflare's CDN (Content Delivery Network) to cache and serve static assets, reducing server load and improving response times.
